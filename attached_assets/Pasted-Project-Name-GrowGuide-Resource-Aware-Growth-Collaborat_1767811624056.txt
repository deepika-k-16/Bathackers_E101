Project Name

GrowGuide – Resource-Aware Growth & Collaboration Platform for Small Vendors

Goal

Build a full-stack web application that helps small vendors grow and expand using logic-driven, explainable, resource-aware decision-making, instead of paid advertising or black-box AI.

The system must use algorithmic AI (rule-based + optimization), not ML training.

Tech Stack (STRICT)

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Python (Flask)

Database: SQLite (file-based, no external DB)

ORM: SQLAlchemy

No ML models

No paid ad APIs

No auto-posting

Core Principle (VERY IMPORTANT)

AI does NOT decide everything.
AI guides decisions using rules, scores, and constraints.
Humans remain in control.

USER FLOW
1️⃣ Signup / Login

Vendor logs in and provides:

Business name

Business category

Target audience (local / young / general)

Budget (zero / low / medium)

Time availability (hours per week)

Growth goal (visibility / sales / expansion)

Optional: business images & Instagram profile link

2️⃣ Resource Mapping (Algorithm 1)

Convert inputs into numeric scores:

Budget

zero → 0

low → 1

medium → 2

Time availability

< 5 hrs → 0

5–10 hrs → 1

> 10 hrs → 2

Growth Capacity (GC)

GC = budget_score + time_score

3️⃣ Growth Strategy Decision

(Algorithm 2 – Constraint-Aware Logic)

Rule-based logic:

If GC ≤ 1

No paid ads

Recommend collaboration

Organic posting (2 posts/week)

If GC = 2 or 3

Organic promotion

Posting 3–5 times/week

If GC ≥ 4

Suggest paid + organic (suggest only)

For each action, output:

What to do

What to avoid

Clear reason

4️⃣ Platform Recommendation

(Algorithm 3 – Weighted Rules)

Rules:

Instagram → visual + young audience

WhatsApp → local repeat customers

Marketplace → product-based discovery

Factors:

Audience fit

Content ability

Time constraint

5️⃣ Content Guidance (AI-Assisted Only)

AI is used only for:

Caption suggestions

Hashtag suggestions

Human-friendly explanations

Features:

Copy caption

Copy hashtags

Select uploaded image

Preview post

Optional redirect to Instagram (manual posting)

❌ No auto-posting

6️⃣ Vendor Matching

(Algorithm 4 – Complementarity Based)

Match vendors based on:

Same audience

Different business category

Same growth goal

Score:

match_score = audience_match + category_complement + goal_match


Recommend top 3 vendors where score ≥ 2

Explain why the match is suggested

Avoid competitors

7️⃣ Collaboration Feature

Vendors can send collaboration requests

Each request includes:

From vendor

To vendor

Reason for collaboration

Status (open / accepted / rejected)

8️⃣ Expansion / Fundraising Feature

Vendor can post:

“I want to expand and need support”

Includes:

Expansion pitch

Support type (partner / promotion)

Status (open / closed)

Other vendors can:

View requests

Express interest

❌ No payments
❌ No third-party fundraising APIs

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (SQLITE)
SQLite Tables (via SQLAlchemy)
